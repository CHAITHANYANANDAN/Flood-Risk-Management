I used AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to support the development of this project from start to finish. These tools helped me plan, debug, and implement the full-stack application more effectively, especially since I am new to web development.

Understanding the Project

Project Structure and Setup

Backend Development (Node.js + Express)
ChatGPT guided me through setting up a backend server using Express. It helped me:

Initialize npm and install required dependencies

Create a basic API endpoint (/api/hello)

Understand how to run and test the server using the browser and Postman

Fix errors like corrupted package.json or path issues in PowerShell

Frontend Development (React)
With ChatGPTâ€™s help, I created a basic React app that connects to the backend. It explained how to use useEffect and fetch() to call APIs and display responses. It also guided me in running the frontend and testing it on localhost.

Error Handling and Debugging
Whenever I encountered terminal errors, project setup issues, or failed connections between frontend and backend, ChatGPT explained what went wrong and how to fix it.

UI Design Support
I used Claude AI specifically for UI layout suggestions, such as how to organize the dashboard, map view, and user interactions. Claude helped shape the look and feel of the interface.
